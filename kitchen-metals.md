Eating or drinking from **तांबे (Copper)**, **पितळ (Brass)**, and **कांस्य (Bronze)** utensils has deep roots in Ayurvedic science.
Here’s a clear breakdown of the **benefits and cautions** for each metal:

---

### 🟠 **1. तांबे (Copper) — Copper Utensils**

**Common use:** Drinking water stored in a copper vessel overnight (“तांब्याचं पाणी”).

**✅ Health Benefits (as per Ayurveda & modern science):**

* **Antimicrobial properties:** Copper kills harmful bacteria (like *E. coli* and *Salmonella*).
* **Improves digestion:** Helps balance all three *doshas* (Vata, Pitta, Kapha).
* **Boosts immunity:** Helps in the production of new cells and supports metabolism.
* **Supports liver and thyroid function:** Copper is a trace element needed for enzyme function.
* **Enhances skin health:** Helps in melanin production, giving natural glow.

**⚠️ Caution:**

* Do **not** store acidic foods (like lemon juice, tamarind, curd) — they can react with copper.
* Overuse may cause copper toxicity; use moderately.

### 🟡 **2. पितळ (Brass) — Brass Utensils (Copper + Zinc Alloy)**

**Common use:** Plates, lamps, or cooking utensils (with a protective tin coating, called *कलई*).

**✅ Health Benefits:**

* **Zinc & copper together** strengthen immunity and aid in hemoglobin formation.
* **Balances body temperature:** Brass maintains food’s natural warmth and flavor.
* **Improves digestion:** Especially beneficial when *kalai*-coated (to prevent direct metal reaction).
* **Promotes healthy skin and brain function:** Due to trace zinc content.

**⚠️ Caution:**

* Use only *kalai-coated* brass for cooking or serving acidic foods.
* Without coating, it may react with sour ingredients and cause metal leaching.

### 🟤 **3. कांस्य (Bronze / कास्य) — Bronze Utensils (Copper + Tin Alloy)**

**Common use:** Serving plates, bowls, and traditional temple utensils.

**✅ Health Benefits:**

* **Balances Pitta (heat energy)** and improves digestion.
* **Enhances immunity:** Tin and copper together support enzyme and hormonal balance.
* **Improves eyesight & mental strength:** Traditional texts link bronze use to *ojas* (vital energy).
* **Naturally alkaline:** Helps reduce acidity and detoxify the body.
* **Anti-inflammatory properties.**

**⚠️ Caution:**

* Not ideal for cooking on direct flame — mainly for eating or serving.
* Avoid very sour foods (like curd, tomato, tamarind).
